12/3/2018 - There is currently an issue with the uoOutlands_Beanbags.xml file.
	    It says that it is corrupt; however, even removing the local 
	    repository and pulling the file from git didn't resolve the issue.
	    Somehow, the master .xml file became corrupt. Will need to grab
	    the working .xml from a separate machine to upload. Make a separate
	    branch for working backups.
